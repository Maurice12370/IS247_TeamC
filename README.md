Project Name: Student Management System

What problem is our project trying to solve:
The Student Management System (SMS) project aims to solve the problem of managing student records efficiently in an educational institution. 
It allows administrators to easily add, update, delete, and search for student information. By organizing student data in a structured manner, 
the system helps keep track of students' personal details, course enrollments, and grades. Additionally, it can generate reports to provide insights 
into student performance and course participation. This project simplifies the process of handling student information, making it more accessible and 
manageable for school administrators.
